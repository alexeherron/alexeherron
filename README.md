### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex, a software engineer with a passion for creativity and solving puzzles, which is what brought me to freelance web development. My background is in biotechnology, but I loved geeking out with the genetic data in spreadsheets and decided to see if I loved coding (I did).

I'm also a big believer in nurturing and empowering communities, which is why I volunteer as the Co-director of [Coding & Cocktails](https://codingandcocktails.kcwomenintech.org/) an introductory programming series for women, complete with custom crafted cocktails.

Of course, to love coding means to love learning. I am a currently on the Data Analysis track through [Launchcode](https://www.launchcode.org), set to graduate in June of 2023.
