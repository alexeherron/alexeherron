### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex, a software engineer with a passion for creativity and solving puzzles, which is what brought me to freelance web development and data analysis. My background is in biotechnology, but I loved geeking out with the genetic data in spreadsheets and decided to see if I loved coding (I did).

I'm also a big believer in nurturing and empowering communities, which is why I volunteer as the Co-director of [Coding & Cocktails](https://codingandcocktails.kcwomenintech.org/), an introductory programming series for women, complete with custom crafted cocktails.


2023 goals:
- Daily coding challenge in javascript or python
- Attend lots of networking events, maybe a conference or two
- Help more local business owners create beautiful, functional websites
